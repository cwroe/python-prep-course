# Summary
This is a summary of the videos you just watched. We will go over some of the most important things you should have learned.

Students should now understand how to use if, elif, and else. They should know that WHITESPACE MATTERS!! They should understand that the order of their elif’s matter, and know how to use comparison operators. One of the videos introduces try/except, they don’t really need to be too familiar with that for now.
